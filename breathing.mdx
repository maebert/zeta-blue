When we inhale, oxygen from the air enters your lungs and is absorbed into the bloodstream. This oxygen is then transported throughout the body to be used in a process called cellular respiration.

Cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells convert nutrients (usually glucose, but also other sugars, fats, and even proteins) into energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$ — think of it as a rechargeable battery that can be sent anywhere in your body for later use), and as a byproduct, produce carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).

$CO_2$ then diffuses out of the cells back into the bloodstream, is carried to the lungs, and exhaled. All that happens within every single breath.

<InfoBox title="The Breathing Diet" description="Ever wondered how you lose weight? Hint: it’s not going out any of the holes you’re thinking about." >
 In fact, you lose weight simply by breathing.  Mitochondria in your cells use oxygen and glucose to produce ATP and $CO_2$ — the glucose is either taken from what’s readily available, or is converted from fat stored in your cells in a process called gluconeogenesis. Now, for the chemistry nerds, that looks like this:

$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2  → 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$$

​In other words, we’re taking one glucose molecule that comes from your body’s fat storage and 6 oxygen molecules, and we produce 6 carbon dioxide molecules and 6 water molecules (there’s a lot more steps involved to produce the ATP, but for the purpose of figuring out where your belly fat goes, this is it).

If you do the math and look up the atomic weights, you’ll find out that in order to turn 1kg of donuts into thin air, you also need to inhale about 2.9kg of oxygen, which in turn produces 2.8kg of $CO_2$ and 1.1kg of water. A typical breath takes in about 500ml of air, which contains about 0.15g of oxygen. As we take between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, you can quickly calculate that you need 16 — 24 hours to breathe in enough oxygen to metabolize 1kg of glucose.

So can we just breathe more to lose more weight? Is conscious connected breath the ultimate weight loss tool? Unfortunately not, otherwise I’d look like Jared Leto already. As we’ll discuss in detail below, what matters is how quickly your cells can convert the oxygen into power — your metabolic rate. A lot of the effects of CCB are specifically because we’re breathing way more than our metabolism requires. So regretfully, the best way to lose weight is still to eat less stuff and burn more energy.

## What happens during CCB?

Due to the increased frequency and depth, we take in a lot more oxygen — this is particularly true when breathing through the mouth instead of the nose. Normally, our body does that automatically when we exercise — our cells have a higher need for energy so the body tries to get more oxygen to create that sweet $ATP$. During conscious connected breath however, we don’t actually have a much higher demand for energy. Hence our cells won’t use all the oxygen available to produce $ATP$, and as a by-product, $CO_2$. We still exhale all the $CO_2$ available though, so over time we build up some excess oxygen, but get rid of the $CO_2$ much faster.

As a result, we will have much less $CO_2$ in our blood than oxygen, which is the key mechanism that produces the effects we observe in our practice.

<InfoBox title="Hyperventilation" description="I often jokingly refer to CCB as “facilitated hyperventilation” (I also refer to restorative yoga as facilitated napping). But… is it?" >
 Typically hyperventilation is associated with fast, shallow breathing, so breathwork practitioners will quickly tell you that this is not what we’re doing. Medically though, hyperventilation simply refers to breathing more than we need to given the metabolic demands at the moment. So yes, conscious connected breath is precisely a form of hyperventilation.
