## How does conscious connected breath affect the body and the mind?

As a cognitive neuroscientist and professionally curious person, I have a strong urge to understand what’s going on during my breathwork practice.

This write-up is concerned with the physiological effects of conscious connected breath, and how these physiological changes result in the perceived effects of sensory arousal, tetany, altered states of consciousness, and others.

The quick TL;DR is that while the purely physiological responses like tingling, burning, and cramping are very well understood, the psychological responses are very much not. In general, there’s a big explanatory gap between what’s happening on a biochemical level (more of this neurotransmitter and less of that), and how that produces the perceived subjective effects.

Mostly, this is due to experimental limitations (most people show a regrettable reluctance to having their brain sliced open while conscious enough to explain which effects of breathwork they’re feeling), and we might be many years to decades away from a solid physiological understanding of altered states of consciousness. I will update this guide as I find new information.

I should note that I’m not a physician, or biochemist, or active researcher (anymore), so please take everything with a grain of salt, add a comment if anything is unclear, or you invariably know something I don’t.

As a final note, when facilitating breathwork sessions, I generally only tell people that tingling and cramping of mouth and hands are a normal physiological response and they’re welcome to ask more about it after the session if they’d like to be bored to death, as I don’t think knowledge of these things is essential for a healthy practice.
